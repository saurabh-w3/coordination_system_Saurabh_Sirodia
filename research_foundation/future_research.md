# Future Research
- Reputation-weighted gossip merges and adversarial agents.
- Contextual bandits per agent to select micro-policies.
- Real bank agents with diverse risk appetites and SLAs.
- Formal analysis of convergence and fairness tradeoffs.


## Implementation Enhancements
- **Reputation weighting:** down-weight noisy agents during gossip merges.  
- **Adaptive token refill:** long-running systems can introduce a budget refuel policy.  
- **Bank agents:** explicit downstream agents with private risk appetites and SLAs to negotiate with LeadGeneration.  
- **Adversarial resilience:** detect & penalize manipulative bidding strategies.
