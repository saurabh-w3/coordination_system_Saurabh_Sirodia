# Emergent Behaviors

- **Self-spacing:** verification stops hammering rate-limited endpoints after penalties; calls spread over time.
- **Price convergence:** as counters merge, agentsâ€™ local price views align.
- **Specialization:** over the run, some agents focus on computation (EMI), others on verification, driven purely by local incentives.
- **Graceful degradation:** even with agent dropout or lossy gossip, applications progress to eligibility/lead in most runs.
